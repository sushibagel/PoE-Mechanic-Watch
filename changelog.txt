Fixed some issues with Influenced Map tracking

v1.2.1
Added a notification sound for reminders. 
        Note: The notification sound is off by default. 
Added a "Sound Settings" tray menu option. 
Added the following items for sound support:
    notification.ini    to      Resources/Settings
    "Sounds" Folder     to      Resources
    reminder.wav        to      Resources/Sounds

Added Influenced map tracking for the Searing Exarch and Eater of Worlds mechanics. Upon entering a map the counter will be ticked and a message displayed, the counter can be decreased using a hotkey (programmable) and increased by clicking on the icon. 
Added a "Change Hotkey" tray menu option. This allows you to set a new hotkey for reversing the map count by 1. 
Added the following items for Influenced Map tracking:
        Influences.txt          to      Resources/Data
        eater.png               to      Resources/Images
        searing.png             to      Resources/Images
        hotkeyselect.ahk        to      Resources/Scripts
        Influences.ahk          to      Resources/Scripts
        Hotkeys.ini             to      Resources/Settings
