Significantly reworked the script for better modularity, readability and to make adding future mechanics simpler. 
Added an option to Launch Path of Exile to the Tray Menu.(Note: The game will need to be launched at least once with the script open before this works.)
Added the following files:
    Overlay.ahk         to:     Resources/Scripts/
    Reminder.ahk        to:     Resources/Scripts/
    Move.ahk            to:     Resources/Scripts/
    UpdateCheck.ahk     to:     Resources/Scripts/
    LaunchPath.txt      to:     Resources/Data/

Added an Auto Enable/Disable feature. https://youtu.be/kMowzpj714A
(Note: Auto Enable requires the the corresponding mechanic to be turned on seperately.)
Added an option "Select Auto Enable" to the tray menu. 
Auto Enable/Disable is currently only supported by Blight, Expedition and Incursion.
(Note: For Incursion Auto Disable only happens after the completion of the 3rd encounter. If 3 Incursions aren't completed click the button to disable the reminders.)
Added the following files to enable support for Auto Enable/Disable
    blightdialogs.txt               Resources/Data/
    blightdialogsdisable.txt        Resources/Data/
    expeditiondialogs.txt           Resources/Data/
    expeditiondialogsdisable.txt    Resources/Data/
    incursiondialogs.txt            Resources/Data/
    incursiondialogsdisable.txt     Resources/Data/
    AutoMechanics.ini               Resources/Settings/
    AutoMechanicSelector.ahk        Resources/Scripts/

For this to work the "Output Dialogue To Chat" setting MUST be turned on in the "UI" section of the settings in game. 
I'm considering this feature to be a in Beta as it's very likely not going to work in all scenarios. I've tried to be as thorough as possible in adding dialogs but I may have missed some as there is some variance in the. To give me feedback on this feature feel free to message me on Reddit at: Sushibagels, Message me in game at ExilesFate, on the Path Of Exile website at Sushibagel, or through the Github issue tracker.
